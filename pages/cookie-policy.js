                <h3 className={Styles.cookieSubTitle}>About Cookies</h3>
                <p className={Styles.cookieSubParagraph}>Whenever you visit a website, small text files called Web Cookies would get downloaded
                    automatically to your computer system or mobile device. The significant purpose of a web cookie is
                    to recognize the user of the website and perhaps to save your login information and to prepare
                    customized Web Pages for the easy and fast access of the same website next time. Only the server
                    of the website you visit will be able to read and retrieve the information of its particular web cookie.
                    Hence, while accessing a single web page online, it would store various cookies automatically from
                    every possible source to the computer system or mobile. Cookies are browsing data of each website
                    stored by the browser. Therefore, considering the cookies as a software or a virus is totally a wrong
                    concept and a false presumption.
                 </p>
                <h3 className={Styles.cookieSubTitle}>Cookies Used By Websites</h3>
                <p className={Styles.cookieSubParagraph}>Every cookie contains certain information with which the websites that you access frequently will

                    the cookies stored on your device and retrieve your personal details to market their products.
                    Therefore, cookies facilitate them to source their desired customers by providing essential details of
                    customers like their territory, their habits, and their preferences.
